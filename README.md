This code is written in MATLAB, and implements the ProposalFlow and its benchmark in [1]. For the RSF dataset, see our project page: 

# Usage #1: Benchmark for ProposalFlow
  We use the RSF dataset (included) to evaluate sparse and dense versions of ProposalFlow.

## Dependencies
  - Download [VLFeat] (http://www.vlfeat.org/) and [MatConvNet] (http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/).
  - Download the following source codes of object proposal or other proposal methods you would like to test:
    - [EdgeBox] (https://github.com/pdollar/edges);
